# no-data-hazard
The term project of Advanced Computer Architecture Course (BB) taught at Hacettepe University. 

It includes a mock part of compiler implementation for 5-stage pipelined MIPS ISA, written in Python. Specifically, the program will prevent some type of data hazards for MIPS processors with and without forwarding logic by inserting NOPs between dependent instructions.
